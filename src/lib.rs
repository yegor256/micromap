//! This is a simpler and faster alternative implementation of the standard `HashMap`.
//! It doesn't use heap and doesn't use hashing at all. It simply keeps all key-value
//! pairs in an array and when it's necessary to retrieve by key, it scrolls through
//! the entire array. This implementation works much faster for small maps of
//! less than 50 keys, but definitely is not suitable for larger maps.
//!
//! Check [this page](https://github.com/yegor256/micromap#benchmark)
//! for the recent benchmarking results.
//!
//! For example, here is how a map with a few keys can be created:
//!
//! ```
//! use micromap::Map;
//! let mut m : Map<u64, &str, 10> = Map::new();
//! m.insert(1, "Hello, world!");
//! m.insert(2, "Good bye!");
//! # #[cfg(std)]
//! assert_eq!(2, m.len());
//! ```
//!
//! Creating a [`Map`] requires knowing the maximum size of it, upfront. This is
//! what the third type argument `10` is for, in the example above. The array
//! will have exactly ten elements. An attempt to add an 11th element will lead
//! to a panic.

/// For example, this is how you make a map, which is allocated on stack and is capable of storing
/// up to eight key-values pairs:
///
/// ```
/// let mut m : micromap::Map<u64, &str, 8> = micromap::Map::new();
/// m.insert(1, "Jeff Lebowski");
/// m.insert(2, "Walter Sobchak");
/// # #[cfg(std)]

/// It is faster because it doesn't use a hash function at all. It simply keeps
/// all pairs in an array and when it's necessary to find a value, it goes through
/// all pairs comparing the needle with each pair available. Also it is faster
/// because it doesn't use heap. When a [`Map`] is being created, it allocates the necessary
/// space on stack. That's why the maximum size of the map must be provided in
/// compile time.
///
/// It is also faster because it doesn't grow in size. When a [`Map`] is created,
/// its size is fixed on stack. If an attempt is made to insert too many keys
/// into it, it simply panics. Moreover, in the "release" mode it doesn't panic,
/// but its behaviour is undefined. In the "release" mode all boundary checks
/// are disabled, for the sake of higher performance.
