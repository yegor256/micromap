A much faster alternative of [`HashMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html), 
for very small maps. It is also faster than
[FxHashMap](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-hash),
[hashbrown](https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown),
[ArrayMap](https://github.com/robjtede/tinymap),
and 
[nohash-hasher](https://github.com/paritytech/nohash-hasher). 
The smaller the map, the higher the
performance. When the map contains more than 20 keys, it may be better to use the standard 
[`HashMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html), since
the performance of `micromap::Map` _may_ start to degrade. See the 
[benchmarking results](#benchmark) below.

The only important restriction is that both key and value must implement 
the [`Copy`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html) trait.

**WELCOME**: 
Not all functions that you might expect to have in a map are implemented. 
I will appreciate if you contribute by implementing these missing functions.
Here is [a full list](https://github.com/yegor256/micromap/issues) of missed features.

First, add this to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
micromap = "0.0.5"
```

Then, use it like a standard hash map... well, almost:

```rust
use micromap::Map;
let mut m : Map<u64, &str, 10> = Map::new(); // allocation on stack
m.insert(1, "foo");
m.insert(2, "bar");
assert_eq!(2, m.len());
```

Pay attention, here the map is created with an extra generic argument `10`. This is 
the total size of the map, which is allocated on stack when `::new()` is called. 
Unlike `HashMap`, the `Map` doesn't use heap at all. If more than ten keys will be
added to the map, it will panic.

Read [the API documentation](https://docs.rs/micromap/latest/micromap/). The struct
[`micromap::Map`](https://docs.rs/micromap/latest/micromap/struct.Map.html) is designed as closely similar to 
[`std::collections::HashMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html) as possible.

## Benchmark

There is a summary of a simple benchmark, where we compare `micromap::Map` with
a few other Rust maps, changing the total capacity of the map (horizontal axis).
We apply the same interactions 
([`benchmark.rs`](https://github.com/yegor256/micromap/blob/master/tests/benchmark.rs)) 
to them and measure how fast they perform. The numbers above 1.0 indicate performance
gain, while numbers below 1.0 demonstrate performance loss.

<!-- benchmark -->
| | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 | 64 | 128 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hashbrown::HashMap` | 26M | 26M | 3.78 | 2.34 | 1.17 | 0.48 | 0.22 | 0.12 |
| `nohash_hasher::BuildNoHashHasher` | 19M | 19M | 3.96 | 2.84 | 0.96 | 0.44 | 0.21 | 0.11 |
| `rustc_hash::FxHashMap` | 19M | 20M | 3.68 | 2.30 | 1.27 | 0.45 | 0.22 | 0.12 |
| `std::collections::HashMap` | 30M | 30M | 6.27 | 4.04 | 2.18 | 1.14 | 0.48 | 0.25 |
| `tinymap::array_map::ArrayMap` | 1M | 1M | 2.44 | 2.22 | 2.13 | 2.25 | 1.97 | 2.04 |

There were 1000000 repetition cycles.

<!-- benchmark -->

As you see, the highest performance gain is achieved for maps that are smaller than ten keys.
For a maps of just a few keys, the gain is enormous.

## How to Contribute

First, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then:

```bash
$ cargo test -vv
```

If everything goes well, fork repository, make changes, send us a [pull request](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html).
We will review your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly,
provided they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration,
before sending us your pull request please run `cargo test` again. Also, 
run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.
